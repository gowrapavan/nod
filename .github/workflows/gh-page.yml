HOSTING AND DEPLOYMENT
Host on GitHub Pages
Host your site on GitHub Pages with continuous deployment using project, user, or organization pages.
Prerequisites 
Create a GitHub account
Install Git
Create a Hugo site and test it locally with hugo server.
Types of sites 
There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on GitHub. User and organization sites are connected to a specific account on GitHub.com.

See the GitHub Pages documentation to understand the requirements for repository ownership and naming.

Procedure 
Step 1
Create a GitHub repository.
Step 2
Push your local repository to GitHub.
Step 3
Visit your GitHub repository. From the main menu choose Settings > Pages. In the center of your screen you will see this:

Step 4
Change the Source to GitHub Actions. The change is immediate; you do not have to press a Save button.

Step 5
Create an empty file in your local repository.
.github/workflows/hugo.yaml
Step 6
Copy and paste the YAML below into the file you created. Change the branch name and Hugo version as needed.
.github/workflows/hugo.yaml
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

# Default to bash
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      HUGO_VERSION: 0.125.4
    steps:
      - name: Install Hugo CLI
        run: |
          wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \

        with:
          submodules: recursive
          fetch-depth: 0

          # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules
          HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production
          HUGO_ENV: production
          TZ: America/Los_Angeles
        run: |
          hugo \
            --gc \
            --minify \
            --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"          
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./public

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
Step 7
Commit the change to your local repository with a commit message of something like “Add workflow”, and push to GitHub.
Step 8
From GitHub’s main menu, choose Actions. You will see something like this:
screen capture

Step 9
When GitHub has finished building and deploying your site, the color of the status indicator will change to green.

Step 10
Click on the commit message as shown above. You will see this:

Under the deploy step, you will see a link to your live site.

In the future, whenever you push a change from your local repository, GitHub will rebuild your site and deploy the changes.

Customize the workflow 
The example workflow above includes this step, which typically takes 10‑15 seconds:

- name: Install Dart Sass
  run: sudo snap install dart-sass
You may remove this step if your site, themes, and modules do not transpile Sass to CSS using the Dart Sass transpiler.
